# General Basics

## 0.Git Basics
**I knew what Git and GitHub are, but I never worked with them.After completing the course, I learned a lot of new things for myself.According to this i can say :**

* **All manipulations/commands with Git was new for me and it is very interesting**
* **I was surprised how quickly you can change your mind about Git after this course**:smile:
* **Anyways i will be use Git in my future projects**

## 1.Linux CLI and HTTP
**Although I knew the basic bash commands, repeating them was useful, but without practice, you start to forget even basic things. Therefore, the lesson for me was more than useful.** :satisfied:

**Since I knew almost nothing about HTTP, I can say the following:**
* **Two articles were read more than once and not only in English because the material was a bit complicated for me and I wanted to understand how everything works. After reading, of course, everything became more understandable**:relieved:
* **I was surprised, because previously incomprehensible material was not only useful, but also interesting for me** 
* **Without a doubt, I will try to use the knowledge gained during this lesson in the future**

## 2.Git Collaboration
### What is Version Control
**In this lesson, I really fastened the basic concepts of Git. This lesson is a very cool way to explain how to work with Git**

### GitHub & Collaboration
**Without this lesson, it's hard for beginners to understand how Git and GitHub are interconnected. For me, this lesson was a good repetition of what I know. Of course, I learned some small details that I did not know (for example features of fetch, pool and rebase).**

**After I have started to understand the material better, I will, of course, use Git & GitHub in the future**:smile:

# Front-End Basics
## 3.Intro to HTML & CSS
**Honestly, this course was easy for me, because I know most of it :relieved: However, I do not know very well about DevTools in other browsers other than Google Chrome, so I further read a bit about it**

**I finished all free exercises here.Tasks here were interesting especially in CSS.I also completed a bit of exercise on the freecodecamp**:smile:

**I used HTML & CSS, I use them now, and will use them in future**:exclamation:

## 4.Responsive Web Design
**This course has improved my knowledge of responsive web design.**
* **I studied several patterns of web pages and tried to implement them.**
* **There were a lot of subtleties that I did not understand before.**

**Despite the fact that this is a game, she really helped me to better understand the flex**:frog:

**I also did one of the extra tasks to improve the understanding of the Grid**:deciduous_tree:

## 5.JavaScript Basics
**Honestly, this course for me was extremely interesting and cognitive. I learned a lot of new things.When I started performing freecodecamp, I realized that my knowledge was far from ideal.I knew how to perform most tasks, I devised algorithms for them, but since I did not know the language ideally therefore most tasks were performed with hints.I am a little disappointed in myself. But this will not prevent me from progressing !!!**

## 6.DOM
**During this task, I learned a lot about new things, especially about DOM methods. It was very interesting to create something new, in spite of all the difficulties. Firstly, when you write a code and it does not work, you are disappointed, but if you do not give up and are looking for a solution, you will get unforgettable emotions.**

**Separately, I want to say about the tasks at freecodecamp. For me, several algorithms were relatively simple. But most of them were complicated in the implementation process. I watched hints, searched for similar tasks on the Internet, tried to write. Yes, it was hard for me because I still do not know much about JS.**

**P.S. I will try to accomplish these tasks later, I hope they will not be very difficult, and it will be ridiculous for me to look at these tasks, which I could not have done before without hints.**

 **Code sent for review. I am waiting for approving.**
