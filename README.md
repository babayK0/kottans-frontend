* **All manipulations/commands with Git was new for me and it is very interesting**
* **I was surprised how quickly you can change your mind about Git after this course**:smile:

## 1.Linux CLI and HTTP
**Although I knew the basic bash commands, repeating them was useful, but without practice, you start to forget even basic things. Therefore, the lesson for me was more than useful.** :satisfied:

**Since I knew almost nothing about HTTP, I can say the following:**
* **Two articles were read more than once and not only in English because the material was a bit complicated for me and I wanted to understand how everything works. After reading, of course, everything became more understandable**:relieved:
* **I was surprised, because previously incomprehensible material was not only useful, but also interesting for me** 
* **Without a doubt, I will try to use the knowledge gained during this lesson in the future**

### GitHub & Collaboration
**Without this lesson, it's hard for beginners to understand how Git and GitHub are interconnected. For me, this lesson was a good repetition of what I know. Of course, I learned some small details that I did not know (for example features of fetch, pool and rebase).**

**After I have started to understand the material better, I will, of course, use Git & GitHub in the future**:smile:

## 3.Intro to HTML & CSS
**Honestly, this course was easy for me, because I know most of it :relieved: However, I do not know very well about DevTools in other browsers other than Google Chrome, so I further read a bit about it**
